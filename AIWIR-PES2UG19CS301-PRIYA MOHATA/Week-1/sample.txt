Even the saints say, “God! Do not put us to test.”
A test saps the energies of a person, generates mental agony and makes him incapable of thinking in a proper and logical manner.
Examinees shudder at the thought of the examination and the fear of failure makes them depressed
Evil dreams haunt the students and the dose of admonition given to them regularly disturbs them.
Before the examination, the students suspend pleasure-oriented activities. 
They do not go to the playground. 
They also cancel their picnic schedules and forget about going to the latest movies. 
They are busy with their books.
They go on reading while sipping a cup of tea. 
They go on revising while lying in their beds.
They discuss questions, talk about books and dream about answers.
Some confine themselves to their rooms and stick to chairs while some others sit in remote corners.
